# cs1-graphics
Please keep in mind that this is still a work in progress. This project was made because the pre existing cs1 graphics library does not work with python3. This library takes calls that would work with cs1.graphics and renders the image in turtle instead. 
## Getting Started
to use this library simple write the follwing into your terminal
```
pip3 install cs1-graphics
```
you can then import the functions by writing:
```
from cs1.graphics import *
```
##  Documentation
* [cs1.graphics](http://www.cs1graphics.org/) - cs1 graphics docs
## Built With
* [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) - Used to render graphics
